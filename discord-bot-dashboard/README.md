# Discord Bot Dashboard

## Project Description
Develop a Discord bot dashboard using Chakra UI and Next.js for the frontend. Utilize Node.js and MongoDB for the backend. Implement Discord OAuth for user login and logout functionalities. Users must re-login after a week for security purposes. Store all configurations in a separate config file for easy management. Include a package.json file for easy dependency management. Provide clear instructions on how to run the code in the README file.

## Main Features
- Home page: Display general information and updates.
- Store: Allow users to purchase items using in-game currency.
- Bump: Enable users to bump their server for visibility.
- Market Place: Facilitate buying and selling of items between users.
- Vote: Provide a platform for users to vote for the server.
- Appeal: Allow users to appeal any bans or warnings they have received.
- Profile page: Display user information, statistics, and achievements.
- Card info page: Showcase detailed information about user cards or items.

## Enhancements and Improvements
- Implement real-time updates for notifications and alerts.
- Include a search functionality for users to easily find specific items or information.
- Add a dark mode option for better user experience.
- Implement a responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
- Include data visualization tools to showcase user statistics and trends.
- Implement a feedback system for users to provide suggestions or report issues.
- Integrate automated tasks for server maintenance and moderation.
- Provide detailed analytics for administrators to track user engagement and activity.
